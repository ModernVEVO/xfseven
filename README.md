# Additional
**Blur**: If you want transparency blur (which does a lot of heavy lifting), you will need [Xfwm-effects](https://www.kalideva.com/) and [Imlib2](https://repology.org/project/imlib2/versions) or [Picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom), but no config is currently provided here.

**Microsoft Fonts**: Microsoft fonts have differing names depending on the package manager, so you will need to look for what's it called in the one you're using. (??)

**Terminal font**: The font in the screenshots is [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack)

**Icons**: The icon theme used in the screenshots is [Windows-7](https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-7) by B00merang-Artwork
